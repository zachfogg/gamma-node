          p In my physics studies, while learning about gravity, I was inspired to implement the formula in a visual way. At the time, I was only capable of working with two dimensions, but I plan to use WebGL to rework this into a 3D simulation, probably utilizing Three.js.

          p The very first canvas app I wrote; where it all started. This code is kind of sentimental to me, because I discovered and understood function closures for the first time while writing it. For me, this is when writing JavaScript started to 'click'.

          p Trying to emulate the effect of a camera's zoom functionality, this is the second canvas app I wrote. Although an unnsuccessful attempt at creating the desired zoom effect, I still find this to be a fascinating visual, and the math behind it is interesting as well.
