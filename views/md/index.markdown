### Hi,
#### I'm a web developer.

This very website is one of my latest creations. Here you can find the blog posts I write, samples of my work, and perhaps even love.

This site is built on the new and promising [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). It uses the [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) templating language to define markup, [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) and [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) for styles, and glorious [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) instead of nasty vanilla JavaScript. As the machine demands, I strive for perfection in my code and markup in the context of modern browsers.

You can view or contribute to [its source code](https://github.com/zachfogg/gamma-node) if you like!
